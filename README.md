# py_bulk_image_optimizer
This is a Python script that compresses and converts PNG and JPEG images to the WebP format using the Pillow library. The script takes two input arguments: input_folder and output_folder, which represent the directory containing the original images and the directory where the compressed images will be saved, respectively.
